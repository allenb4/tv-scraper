# TV Scraper

## Overview

TV Scraper is a Node.js application that fetches TV show and cast information from the TVMaze API and stores it in MongoDB. The application provides an API to retrieve the TV shows with their cast details, sorted by birthday.

## Features

- Scrapes TV show and cast data from TVMaze API.
- Stores the data in a MongoDB database.
- Provides a REST API for accessing TV show and cast information.
- Includes unit tests using Jest.
- Configured with a CI pipeline for automated testing.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 21 or higher
- MongoDB (local installation or cloud instance)

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tv-scraper.git
   cd tv-scraper
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:

   ```env
   PORT=3000
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/tvshows
   MONGODB_URI_TEST=mongodb://localhost:27017/tvshows_test
   ```

4. **Start the Application**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Testing

1. **Run Tests**

   To run the unit tests, ensure MongoDB is running and execute:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

2. **Run Tests with Coverage**

   To run tests with coverage reports, use:

   ```bash
   npm run test:coverage
   ```
